# macOS Shortcuts Collection

I like shortcuts, and I hope you do as well. Fork or create a PR if you want to share shortcuts.

#### Editing

`cmd` + `left` or `right`: navigating through beginning and end of a line.

`cmd` + `shift` + `left` or `right`: select entire line.

`cmd` + `top` or `bottom`: top or bottom of the file

`cmd` + `shift` + `top` or `bottom`: select entire file from either top or bottom.

My co-worker Jeff told me the following shortcuts, they work similarly as arrow keys when editing, but not the same when not editing. I only use them in Shell and Vim because I treat them as replacement of my `ctrl` + `hjkl` keybinding since I intentionally disabled them in iTerm for better Vim experience. Part of the reason that they are working is that arguably macOS took some concepts from Unix, so these shortcuts were inherited.

`ctrl` + `a`: go to beginning of the line when editing.

`ctrl` + `e`: go to end of the line when editing.

`ctrl` + `n`: go up when editing, i.e. selecting in intellisense.

`ctrl` + `p`: go down when editing, i.e. selecting in intellisense.

#### System

`control` + `shift` + `power`: shorter to sleep, longer to shut down.

`cmd` + `~`: cycle through different windows in the current application.(one of my favorite OSX shortcuts, doesn't exist in Windows)

`cmd` + `,`: open preference of any application.

`cmd` + `l`: select address bar in any browser.

`cmd` + `w`: close application tab.

`cmd` + `shift` + `w`: close all tabs, but application is still running.

#### Chrome

`control` + `tab` or `control` + `shift` + `tab`: navigating through tabs.
